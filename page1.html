  <h1>My <strong>Favorite</strong> Foods</h1>
  <body>
    <p>I have many favorite foods and cuisines. In terms of cuisines, my favorites are any Asian region, Mexican, Italian, and even sometimes a classic American food. I associate food with memories, so asian food at family gatherings or American food at baseball games is dear in my heart. My favorite specific foods are tacos, pizza, dumplings, and a nice juicy burger.</p>

  <h2>My Favorite <em>Bands</em></h2>
  <body>
    <p>I don't really listen to bands as much as I listen to individual artists; I have only ever had one favorite band, being One Direction when I was in elementary and middle school. Not sure if this counts as a band, but the rap trio Migos was also one of my favorites before one of their members died. 5 Seconds of Summer was another good band when I was younger, but now they don't really do much.</p>
