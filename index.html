    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>My name is Nicole Campbell. I was born in Bellevue, Washington on July 21, 2002, to parents who are die hard husky fans and alumni. I grew up in the Bellevue area my entire life and have gone to Husky football games for as long as I can remember. I love sports and being active, and dream of working for an mlb team one day. I always liked numbers growing up, but hated complicated math, so no wonder I ended up an accounting major! I also love to travel, with some of my favorite places I've gone to being Mexico, Spain, and Hawaii. I am self proclaimed bad at computers, so this assignment was challenging.<p>
